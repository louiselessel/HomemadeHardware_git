#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>

/*
   Based on CapitiveSense Library Demo Sketch from Paul Badger 2008
   Uses a high value resistor e.g. 10 megohm between send pin and receive pin
   Resistor effects sensitivity, experiment with values, 50 kilohm - 50 megohm. Larger resistor values yield larger sensor values.
   Receive pin is the sensor pin - try different amounts of foil/metal on this pin
   Best results are obtained if sensor foil and wire is covered with an insulator such as paper or plastic sheet
